1. Automate 1 tower floor:  the macro which does the floor tapping.
It is a combined macro which uses Auto swap party, Begin FGA, and Sometimes theres a fou (Tap screen once)
2. Auto swap Party: The macro which controls the FGO party swapping and moving from the party screen to the battle screen.
3. Begin FGA (1 run): The macro which activates FGA.
4. Sometimes theres a fou (Tap screen once): Taps the screen once in a relatively safe location (One where stuff usually is not.)
5. ---Try Kinda Hard: FGA battle macro. It is set for all servants to always spam NP and Skills and has no actual battle commands. 
6. Readme: This.

Required:
1. You are on the tower event screen.
2. The FGA start button is in the bottom left.
3. You've set up a good FGA battle macro.
(I recommend a macro with no commands and spam skills and NP)
4. You've set up the auto function in FGO to your liking.
5. You've set up the party CEs to your liking and servants as well.
6. FGA begins with the runs box unchecked and set to 1 (since we'll check it every time, starting with the box checked will make FGA run endlessly which may cause problems.)


How to install:
1. Download this folder.
2. Some android emulators have an import macro function, in the macro screen. Use that and import all four macros.
3. Check the macro settings to see if they are to your liking.
4. Optional: you may inspect the macros themselves in a text editor to change up the screen tapping.
5. Recommended: Make a FGA battle macro. You'll be using this to clear the floors so make sure it's applicable to basically anyone.
I recommend a macro with no commands and spam skills and NP.
6. Recommended: Set up the auto function in FGO, and make sure your CEs are correctly set and your servants are good for violence. 
7. Make sure you set FGA to the appropriate macro, unchecked the run limit box and set run limit to 1.
8. Setup complete.

How This macro works:

It taps a "safe" part of the screen (center far left) three times to clear certain screens
such as "YOU RECIEVED A THING FOR CLEARING A FLOOR ENDING IN 5 OR 0",
receiving fous (FGA does not clear them automatically), and the FGA completed box.

Then it taps bottom far left (where I put my begin FGA button) and taps the boxes to auto 1 run.
Then waits for a bit, then taps the FGO auto make party and begin battle.

The macro stops here, so the next instance will usually start at "FGA COMPLETED" box.


Other notes:

This macro does not work for floors ending in 0s since they have story.
This macro also does not work if floors take you out of the tower quest screen.
LIKE END OF FLOOR 10.
Or NO BATTLE FLOORS. Especially them.

If you want you can set up a macro which runs endlessly but since there's no innate way
to tell the macro to wait until a certain thing happens it's best to tell it to wait for a long time to
account for the actual battle process.

I absolutely recommend a keyboard binding for this macro since that's saves mouse clicks.
I don't really want to get carpal tunnel...

If the numbers aren't right, you can change them yourself. A slower computer will need the
settings to be slower to make sure the clicks occur at appropriate times.
