GOTO Servant Select

Auto EXP
GOTO Servant Select
Select Third
Auto EXP

1: Press a part of the screen to go into servant select. I found near top-left of the card area works.

This is the GOTO macro.
--

2: Press a part of the screen to select the second (topmost row, second from left) card.
This part of the screen is dangerous and can break the macro by returning from enhance to servant select. 

This is the Select Second Macro.
--

3:  Press Auto Select, OK, Enhance, and then OK


4: Press the screen a bunch so that when the animation ends and you are on "Servant gained EXP screen",
you can return to the enhancement screen. I recommend a bit to the left of enhance.

Both are part of Auto EXP All pals.

5: Press a part of the screen to select the third (topmost row, third from left) card.
There are safe spots that won't break the overall macro for this macro

This is Select Third Macro.

6: Finished.

*If you have concerns about lag eating inputs, you can tap multiple times when recording.
