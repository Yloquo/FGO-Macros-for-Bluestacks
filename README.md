# FGO-Macros-for-Bluestacks

---
This is a repository for Macros to be used with Android Emulators. I'm using MSI but I'm including recipes to make your own for the more complex ones. It's because some people liked them and I'm sure I need a space to hold all these macros.
Hopefully they help you as well.

How to use:

You're using an android Emulator. 
Some emulators you can import, for others you might have to make them yourself from the recipes I've given.

You've got a basic understanding of Macros.

Some Macros use FGA as well.

Overview:


All Pals EXP: Feeds EXP to all servants. Eventually.
Best used if you don't care too much for where EXP goes. 
It WILL feed EXP to randos, like your dupe Sthenos, so make sure that they are in second archive or burnt.

Skill Up: It skills up a skill one time. Doing it multiple times can be achieved through toggling the Bluestack settings or
performing the macro multiple times (Or both). 

CE Merging: It feeds EXP to a CE. It makes a CE bomb, but it isn't a 100% efficient CE Bomb process. 
If you're really worried about QP efficiency, don't use this. Otherwise, you're good.
This is affected by lag spikes, but it'll probably make the process miss a cycle. It won't fail spectacularly. 
It'll also hang up if you're trying to feed a CE that's equipped.

Mass Ascension: It ascends all servants that can be ascended, except for the for displayed servant. Since servants talk to you while ascending, there is a lot of waiting between ascending and going to the next servant.

Automate 1 tower floor:
We love towers, don't we. This takes you through 1 floor, using the FGA and auto party function newly introduced in the tower of 2025/2023.
Since there's special events every so often you can't just put this to 100 and do it. At least for the first 100 floors.

Skill Up: 
Set in the Bluestack macro settings how many times you want to skill up. Initialized at 1 time.
Currently in the skill up screen with the skill you want to up selected.

CE Merging: 
Have set a CE to feed EXP to. This will not manually limit break your CE, so you should LB it first.
CE select screen is set to largest (out of the three sizes in the bottom-left). I think it can work with smaller sizes, though.
Equipped CEs will make the process hang, so if you have random low-level CEs equipped, unequip them.
If there's no more stomach, the process will hang on the select a servant screen. 

!!! You've set the filters so the CEs you want to feed are on the top on the CE select screen and
you're absolutely sure you've protected any CEs you don't want to mulch! 
This doesn't go too far on the CE select screen (About 7 lines), but for safety, lock your CEs!!! 


Mass Ascension: 
Have at least 2 servants to ascend.
Servant select screen is set to lowest, and filters are configured properly.

Final notes:
I'm available on Discord, sometimes through emails and Git.
Discord is LXP, usually around the main Goon (SA) Discord and FGO Discord.

Thanks to:
The maker(s) of Fate Grand Automata. Without your work, I'd be in the lotto mines. And also showing everyone that automation is cool, actually.
All the pals in the goon discords. I <3 all of you guys and your ramblings.

This is free for everyone.
You can build on these macros, but credit me, and usage in a for-profit product is no go, though Patreon and Patreon-like transactions are okay.
